\title{Move Semantics in cpp}
\author{epoche}

\p{
  In [cs144 libsponge buffer header](https://github.com/suspenss/Sponge/blob/master/libsponge/util/buffer.hh) has a very strange constructor that I never seen before:

  \pre\verb<<<|
Buffer(std::string &&str) noexcept
    : _storage(std::make_shared<std::string>(std::move(str))) {}
  <<<

  When I'm trying to construct a buffer using \code{Buffer payload = Buffer(str);}, it doesn't work. So I searched this question on the web and I finally found that correct way to use the constructor is \code{Buffer payload = Buffer(std::move(str));}. So I'm going to make some notes about "\strong{Move Semantics}".
