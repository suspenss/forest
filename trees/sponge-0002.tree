\strong{Task 1: Webget}

\p{
  To implement a byte stream based on the reliable transmission interface ([TCP socket](internet-0002)) provided by the system. In pratice, it uses the TCP Socket API such as \code{connect} to establish a connection with server, \code{write} to write some data to the bytestream, \code{read} to read some data from the bytestream, and \code{close} the socket communication finally.
}

\strong{Task 2: In Memory Byte Stream}

\p{
  Task 2 is require us to maintain a container that can push some element to the container's back, and take some element front. So we can use queue, however, the effciency of the queue is very bad when we peek some bytes of certain length,  because in this function we just view them rather than pop them out. In this way, we can use deque to access its internal element, the use \code{[]} operator,  which has only #{O(1)} time complexity.
}

\p{
  In Minnow, [this implementation](https://github.com/epochess/Sponge/blob/master/libsponge/byte_stream.cc) can achieve a throughput of 16Gbit/s.
